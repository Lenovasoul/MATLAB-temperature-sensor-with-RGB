# MATLAB-temperature-sensor-with-RGB
This program takes the temperature of the surrounding area and then based on your thresholds sets the color of an RGB. Above Threshold = Red; Between threshold = Green; Below Threshold = Blue.

Required Libraries: MATLAB support Package for Arduino Hardware,
Arduino Additional Sensors Library (DHT,LPS331), 
Arduino LCD Connection,
DHT Add-On Library for Arduino,
Simulink,
& Simulink Support Package for Arduino Hardware.
